- Layouts should be mobile-first: stack content vertically by default.
- Add responsive Tailwind classes like `md:flex-row`, `lg:grid-cols-2` to scale up.
- Avoid pixel-based media queries; use Tailwind breakpoints only.
- Use `overflow-auto` and `max-w-screen-lg` containers for consistent scaling.
